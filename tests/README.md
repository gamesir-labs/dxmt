# DXMT tests

All DXMT correctness tests run through Wine. Meson launches one Windows suite
scheduler, which starts API-isolated GoogleTest coordinators with Win32
`CreateProcessW`. Each coordinator discovers, partitions, and starts its own
test workers inside the same Wine session. This reuses the Wine prefix, Wine
server, loaded runtime, and staged DXMT build without loading incompatible
Metal3 and Metal4 backends into one Windows process.

```

`d3d11/capability_spec.cpp` and `d3d12/capability_spec.cpp` reconstruct the
observable device-probe contracts used by Unreal Engine 5.7.4's Windows RHI.
They deliberately depend only on public DXGI/D3D interfaces: no Unreal Engine
headers, source, shaders, binaries, configuration types, or implementation text
are copied into DXMT. The cases are split by adapter identity, probe/final
device creation, feature queries, format support, MSAA, memory budgets, COM
interface consistency, descriptors, and queue behavior so failures identify a
single capability boundary. The D3D12 suite also feeds the live feature level,
shader model, resource binding tier, WaveOps, and typed atomic64 reports through
UE's complete SM6 gate, including the Intel-emulation policy branch and valid
SM5 fallback. The live macOS/Wine probe treats that Windows-only vendor
extension as unavailable.

`tests/meson.build` owns the only Meson/Wine test entry, the top-level scheduler,
the shared GoogleTest runner, and the API-isolated test images. The API-specific
Meson files only export source and dependency lists; they must not register
their own Wine invocation.

## Add a test

Place API-visible behavior under the matching `tests/d3d*/` directory, include
the stable header, and use GoogleTest normally:

```cpp
#include <dxmt_test.hpp>

TEST(D3D12ExampleSpec, DoesSomething) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1 + 1, 2);
}
```

Add the source and any additional dependency to that API's `meson.build`. The
central manifest automatically links it into the matching Wine suite image.
Framework-only Wine tests live under `tests/wine/` and are registered directly
in `tests/meson.build`. They may validate the test runner itself, but must not
include or link DXMT implementation code.

## Public API boundary

DXMT correctness is tested only through public Direct3D and DXGI interfaces.
Tests must not include implementation headers, compile implementation sources
into a test image, invoke private translator CLIs, use test-only backend fault
switches, or inspect implementation-only cache keys and state. Shader,
descriptor, command, resource, synchronization, query, and presentation
behavior must be asserted through API-visible results such as HRESULTs, COM
identity, feature reports, readbacks, query data, fences, and presentation
statistics.

The former direct implementation tests were handled by observable scope:

- COM/private-data, descriptor, command-list, format, resource, and query
  behavior is covered by the corresponding D3D10/11/12 API suites.
- DXBC/DXIL and airconv behavior is covered by public shader compilation,
  pipeline creation, execution/readback, and malformed-container rejection.
- Internal allocation, cache, diagnostic, threading, parser representation,
  and scheduling details have no public D3D contract and therefore are not
  correctness-test targets.

`tests/ci/test_public_api_boundary.py` enforces this boundary in the repository
test suite.

## Mark slow tests

`slow` is a relative scheduling-cost hint. A slow test remains a correctness
test and is always included in the standard `unit` run.

```cpp
DXMT_SLOW_TEST(PipelineCacheTest, RestoresLargeArchive) {
  // Correctness assertions remain unchanged.
}
```

Parameterized or typed tests can attach the same cost through a GoogleTest
glob:

```cpp
DXMT_SLOW_TEST_PATTERN("LargeCases/PipelineCacheTest.*/*");
```

The scheduler assigns slow cases a larger estimated cost and uses
longest-processing-time-first partitioning so they do not accumulate in one
tail worker.

## Scheduler model

- The outer wrapper starts Wine exactly once for
  `dxmt-wine-test-scheduler.exe`.
- The suite scheduler allocates the global worker budget across framework,
  D3D10, D3D11, and D3D12 coordinators. A one-job run executes suites
  sequentially; larger budgets run API suites concurrently.
- API isolation prevents D3D11's Metal3 DXGI backend and D3D12's Metal4 backend
  from competing inside one process.
- Each API coordinator applies GoogleTest filtering and disabled-test rules in
  memory before planning.
- The default worker count is bounded by the logical CPU count and amortized so
  each worker receives at least four normal-test cost units.
- Every worker is created inside Wine with `CreateProcessW`, receives one
  `--gtest_filter` batch, and is awaited by the coordinator.
- `DXMT_SERIAL_TEST_F` removes a test from the parallel wave. It keeps a
  dedicated worker by default; `DXMT_GROUP_SERIAL_TESTS(pattern, group)` may
  reuse one worker for a reviewed set of serial tests that safely share
  process-global, device, and window state. `DXMT_SERIAL_TEST_DOMAIN` identifies
  groups that conflict with themselves but may share a bounded two-worker wave
  with another domain. Untagged serial workers remain globally exclusive.
- Workers record per-test elapsed time in the managed Wine prefix. Later runs
  use an exponential moving average of those measurements as LPT shard costs;
  source annotations remain the cold-run fallback and minimum cost.
- Meson registers only the suite scheduler with `is_parallel: false` because
  all unit parallelism is owned inside the Wine process tree.
- Workers print failures only by default. Set `DXMT_TEST_VERBOSE_WORKERS=1` for
  full GoogleTest output.
- `fail_fast`, `break_on_failure`, and `throw_on_failure` are forced off, while
  C++ exceptions are caught as failures. Every coordinator waits for its
  workers, and the suite scheduler waits for every coordinator before printing
  the collected output and final status.
- Within one suite, GoogleTest XML output, result streaming, or external
  GoogleTest sharding uses one worker because multiple writers cannot share an
  output safely.

Override concurrency with `--dxmt-test-jobs=<count>` or
`DXMT_TEST_JOBS=<count>`. The top-level scheduler treats this as a global budget
and divides it among active API suites. Tests must not depend on mutable
process-global state from another test, and shared filesystem artifacts must
use unique paths.

A crash terminates the affected worker batch; other workers still finish. The
no-short-circuit guarantee applies to assertion failures and caught exceptions,
not to the remaining tests inside a process that has crashed.

## Build and run

Use the full x64 builder profile. It shares one incremental build directory and
one staged Wine runtime across runtime, tests, and benchmarks:

```sh
scripts/dxmt-builder build --profile gcc-x64-release-full tests-all
scripts/dxmt-builder test --profile gcc-x64-release-full unit
```

Filter a subsystem without creating another Wine test image:

```sh
scripts/dxmt-builder test --profile gcc-x64-release-full unit \
  --suite d3d12 --test-args='--gtest_filter=D3D12*'
```

Every discovered test also has a process-independent CaseId formed from the
API suite and full GoogleTest name. List IDs or replay an exact case with:

```sh
scripts/dxmt-builder test --profile gcc-x64-release-full unit \
  --suite d3d12 --test-args='--dxmt-list-case-ids'
scripts/dxmt-builder test --profile gcc-x64-release-full unit \
  --suite d3d12 \
  --test-args='--dxmt-case-id=D3D12.CopyTextureSpec.FullFootprintMatrix'
```

CaseId filters accept the same `*`, `?`, `:`, and negative-pattern syntax as
GoogleTest filters. `DXMT_TEST_CASE_ID` provides the environment equivalent,
and the documented replay spelling `--dxmt_case_id=` remains accepted. Worker
failure summaries print the CaseId before the assertion diagnostic.

### Native Windows behavior oracle

The D3D10, D3D11, and D3D12 test executables are standalone x86-64 Windows
PEs. Copy them without any DXMT runtime DLLs so the loader selects the system
Direct3D and DXGI implementations. The scheduler uses Win32 `CreateProcessW`
and therefore works unchanged outside Wine.

Run one public D3D12 behavior case against the default adapter with:

```powershell
.\dxmt-wine-d3d12-tests.exe --dxmt-test-jobs=1 `
  --dxmt-case-id=D3D12.SparseMappingMatrixSpec.MapsMoreThanThirtyTwoDisjointRanges
```

Set `DXMT_TEST_WINDOWS_ADAPTER=warp` before launching to select Microsoft WARP.
Set `DXMT_TEST_WINDOWS_DEBUG_LAYER=1` to enable the D3D12 debug layer before
device creation; this requires the Windows Graphics Tools optional feature.
If the requested debug layer is unavailable, device initialization fails
instead of silently running without validation. Debug-layer messages are copied
from `ID3D12InfoQueue1` to standard error so redirected oracle logs retain the
message severity, category, ID, and description.

The builder places `run-windows-oracle.bat` beside all three executables. The
default invocation runs the complete D3D10 and D3D11 suites on the default
Windows adapter, followed by the complete D3D12 suite on WARP. It
writes per-API logs plus shared metadata under `windows-oracle-results`. The
banner and metadata identify this contract as suite schema `public-api-v1`:

```bat
run-windows-oracle.bat
run-windows-oracle.bat --debug
run-windows-oracle.bat --hardware
run-windows-oracle.bat --case D3D12.ClearUavSpec.ClearTexture3DSliceRange
```

`--debug` runs the complete D3D12 suite in one worker with the debug layer so
validation messages are not lost across scheduler child processes. `--case`
runs only the named D3D12 CaseId.

Create a transfer-ready ZIP containing all three EXEs, the script,
instructions, and checksums with:

```sh
scripts/dxmt-builder package --profile gcc-x64-release-full windows-oracle
```

The D3D suites must use only public Direct3D and DXGI APIs and must run under
the native Windows runtime. DXMT-private exports, backend fault injection,
implementation cache keys, and unportable invalid-input probes do not belong in
these suites.

Batched tests may register stable logical CaseIds below the outer GoogleTest.
The copy matrix exposes `D3D12.Copy.Buffer.ShuffledRegion.0000` through
`.4095`, and the uint arithmetic matrix exposes
`D3D12.Shader.Arithmetic.Uint32.00000` through `.16383`. Together they provide
20,480 deterministic logical cases while using only two batched outer tests.
Selecting one ID records and validates only that logical case, while also
checking that every unselected output remains poison. Registered logical cases
can emit one JSON object per line with their class, requirements, execution
path, setup, operation sequence, oracle, diagnostic state, and scheduler cost:

```sh
scripts/dxmt-builder test --profile gcc-x64-release-full unit \
  --suite d3d12 \
  --test-args='--dxmt-case-id=D3D12.Copy.Buffer.ShuffledRegion.0042'

DXMT_WINE_ROOT=.cache/wine-source/install \
  DXMT_TEST_VERBOSE_WORKERS=1 scripts/wine-test-wrapper.sh \
  .cache/managed/profiles/gcc-x64-release-full/build/tests/dxmt-wine-d3d12-tests.exe \
  --dxmt-list-case-metadata \
  --dxmt-case-id=D3D12.Shader.Arithmetic.Uint32.00042
```

On a mismatch, a matrix reports the logical CaseId and parameters, first
mismatching index, expected and actual values, and an exact replay argument.

`scripts/dxmt-builder test` compiles and stages the current DXMT DLLs, initializes the
dedicated prefix when needed, and injects the staged runtime before starting the
coordinator. Do not run the PE directly when validating DXMT behavior, because
that can silently select stale DLLs.

## Quality-gate assets (not wired into the CLI yet)

Standalone runner scripts (`run-d3d12-*.sh/py`, `check-d3d12-coverage.py`,
`run-wine-tests.sh`, `wine-test-wrapper.sh`, …) were removed. The supported
test entry point is only:

```sh
scripts/dxmt-builder test --profile gcc-x64-release-full unit|integration|performance
```

Supporting data and helpers remain in-tree for a future CLI subcommand:

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `tests/d3d12/differential/` | WARP oracle PE + snapshot compare |
| `tests/coverage/d3d12_coverage.json` | Public API / coverage thresholds |
| `tests/mutation/d3d12_mutations.json` | Reviewed mutation manifest |

There is no separate coverage/mutation/differential wrapper script.

The managed Wine dependency is fingerprinted below `.cache/managed/deps`.

To use a complete prebuilt Wine cache for a one-off run:

```sh
meson setup \
  --cross-file build-win64.txt \
  -Dnative_llvm_path=/usr/local/opt/llvm@15 \
  -Denable_tests=true \
  -Dwine_build_path= \
  -Dwine_install_path=/path/to/wine-cache \
  .cache/managed/manual/wine-tests \
  --buildtype release
```

The cache must include the Wine launcher, wineserver, development libraries,
and bundled host runtime dylibs. A raw `make install` directory is rejected.

Benchmarks are separate from unit tests but use the same Wine runtime and
staging path. See `benchmarks/README.md`.
