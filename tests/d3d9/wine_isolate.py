"""Wrap each test function call in a Wine conformance module so it can be run
or skipped individually.

Wine runs every test function of a module from one START_TEST in a single
process, so a crash or a hang takes the rest of the module with it and the
functions after it are never measured. Wrapping each call lets the suite re-run
a module while skipping a function that did not survive, which is what turns a
module that crashes into a module that reports results.

The wrapping happens here, at build time, rather than in the corpus: those
sources are fetched from Wine unmodified and must stay that way. Wrapping in
place also preserves each module's own preamble, which registers a window class
and gates the whole module on the display mode, and which a generated wrapper
would have to reproduce exactly.

Two checks fail the build rather than silently reducing coverage:
  - every bare call inside START_TEST must end up wrapped, because one that is
    missed runs unconditionally in every re-run and quietly breaks the isolation
    the re-run depends on
  - the number of calls found must match the recorded count for that module, so
    a corpus that has moved is a loud failure at the pin bump rather than a
    coverage change nobody notices
