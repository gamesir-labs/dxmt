# WMTTextureInfo and WMTBufferInfo are wire structs shared with the C unix side,
# which is compiled as Objective-C, so they cannot carry default member
# initializers of their own. WMTTextureInfo also holds fields a caller has no
# reason to think about: reserved feeds WMTTextureInfoFlag bits straight into
# the texture descriptor, and mach_port selects between creating a shared
# texture and importing one. A site that assigns only the fields it needs
# therefore hands Metal whatever the stack held, which fails far from the
# declaration and only on whichever architecture leaves a nonzero byte there.
# WMTBufferInfo has no such field today and is held to the same rule anyway: a
# per-type carve-out is where the next instance of this would hide.

# Consumer code only. The winemetal headers declare these types and embed them
# in C wire structs, where an initializer is neither possible nor meaningful.
# Excluding rather than allowlisting so a new frontend is guarded on arrival.
