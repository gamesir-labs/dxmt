# Build DXMT

[Our CI](/.github/workflows/ci.yml) is the best reference.

## Prerequisites:
- MacOS Sonoma and later. <sub>It doesn't make a lot of sense to build a project targeting Apple platforms from Windows, Linux or other OSs.</sub>
- Meson 1.3+, it's the build system used by this project
- LLVM 15 (exact major version), with headers and static libs
    - CMake 3.27+, when building LLVM from the source
- Xcode 16+, with Metal toolchain
- Wine 8+, with headers and tools, _if you want to use DXMT with Wine_.
    - A cross-compiler (mingw-w64 or llvm-mingw) for Windows is also required
    - When building DXMT with Wine, it is a **Cross Build**.

The following documentation is NOT for beginners. You are assumed to be familiar with C/C++ compilers and build systems.

## Setup LLVM

First of all, you need to build LLVM (or use a pre-built LLVM package) no matter if you want to use DXMT with Wine or as a native library. Then you need to decide which architecture should you target for LLVM: `x86_64` or `arm64`.

- For a **Cross Build**, you most likely want `x86_64` at the moment.
- Otherwise you probably should use `arm64`, since Intel Macs and Rosetta 2 are being deprecated.

This is an example of building `x86_64` LLVM
```sh
# in root directory of the project
mkdir -p ./toolchains/llvm-build
echo '**' >> toolchains/.gitignore
git clone --depth 1 --branch llvmorg-15.0.7 https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git toolchains/llvm-project

cmake -B ./toolchains/llvm-build -S ./toolchains/llvm-project/llvm \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$(pwd)/toolchains/llvm" \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 \
  -DLLVM_HOST_TRIPLE=x86_64-apple-darwin \
  -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=On \
  -DLLVM_ENABLE_ZSTD=Off \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="" \
  -DLLVM_BUILD_TOOLS=Off \
  -DBUG_REPORT_URL="https://github.com/3Shain/dxmt" \
  -DPACKAGE_VENDOR="DXMT" \
  -DLLVM_VERSION_PRINTER_SHOW_HOST_TARGET_INFO=Off \
  -G Ninja
cmake --build ./toolchains/llvm-build
cmake --install ./toolchains/llvm-build
```

Then `./toolchains/llvm` contains what we need later.

For `arm64` target, just replace any occurance of `x86_64` to `arm64` above.

## Setup Wine

> Skip this part if you are NOT doing a **Cross Build**

See [winehq.org - MacOS Building](https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/wikis/MacOS-Building)

You should also check the target architecture of Wine build, `--enable-archs=i386,x86_64` is a popular option when you also want x86 (32-bit programs) support in addition to x86_64.

DXMT uses the `external/wine` submodule as the default Wine source tree for
cross builds. Meson builds Wine automatically into `external/wine/build` before
linking the Wine-facing DXMT binaries. The default Wine configure arguments are
defined by `wine_configure_args` in [meson.options](/meson.options).

## Build DXMT

### Cross Build

Build (64-bit) Windows PE+ dlls **and** 64-bit unixlib (a Mach-O library with `.so` extension by convention).

```sh
meson setup --cross-file build-win64.txt -Dnative_llvm_path=</path/to/llvm> build-builtin --buildtype release
meson compile -C build-builtin
```

(Optional) Build (32-bit) Windows PE dlls

```sh
meson setup --cross-file build-win32.txt build32 --buildtype release
meson compile -C build32
```

> You can't build 32-bit dlls only, they need 64-bit unixlib to be functional

There are other compile options in [meson.options](/meson.options).

#### apitrace integration

DXMT can link the apitrace recorder directly for development traces. The
integration is gated by a dedicated boolean switch and is independent of the
Meson build type. Pass `-Dapitrace_builtin=true` at configure time to compile
the recorder into the produced DLLs; leave the default `false` for normal
builds. When the flag is off, no apitrace source files participate in the
compile and no apitrace symbols land in `d3d11.dll`, `d3d12.dll`, `dxgi.dll`,
or `winemetal.so`.

The default source checkout is the `external/apitrace` submodule. When enabled,
Meson builds only the required static apitrace recorder libraries into the DXMT
build directory through `scripts/build-apitrace.sh`; it does not build apitrace
Windows DLLs or tools.

At runtime, the integration is opt-in through environment variables:

- `DXMT_APITRACE_ENABLED=1` — activate the in-process recorder. The historical
  misspelling `DXMT_APITRACE_ENBALED=1` is accepted as a spelling-compatible
  alias and is checked first; new scripts should prefer the corrected name.
- `APITRACE_TRACE_BUNDLE=/abs/path/to/trace.apitrace` — explicit bundle root
  shared by the PE D3D stream and unix Metal stream. When unset, the PE side
  picks `<exe-basename>_dxmt_apitrace/trace-<ts>.apitrace` and propagates it to
  the unix side via `__wine_set_unix_env`, so both halves of the process write
  into the same bundle directory.
- `APITRACE_METAL_VERBOSE=1` — emit per-call info logs from the DXMT-side hook
  layer. Useful for confirming the recorder is wired in; noisy in long runs.

When the recorder is active, every produced bundle directory contains three
co-located streams:

- `callstream.jsonl` — D3D11/D3D12/DXGI calls captured on the PE side. Hook
  insertion points are documented in the link-trace plan (§4.3) and cover
  device/swapchain creation, draw/dispatch, resource barriers, command list
  submission, present, map/unmap, and `UpdateSubresource`.
- `metal-callstream.jsonl` — Metal calls recorded by the unix side via the
  existing `winemetal_unix.c` hooks.
- `translation-links.jsonl` — `d3d_sequence ↔ metal_sequence_{begin,end}`
  spans emitted at command-buffer commit time. The `d3d_sequence` field is
  sourced from the apitrace D3D counter when `DXMT_APITRACE_D3D` is defined,
  and falls back to the dxmt internal chunk id otherwise.

The bundle root is created exactly once by the PE side on the first hook
that calls `ensure_session_open()`; the unix side reads the same
`APITRACE_TRACE_BUNDLE`, so the three streams are guaranteed to live under the
same directory.

`apitrace_builtin` is a developer-facing build flag and is intentionally absent
from `dxmt.conf`. The recorder is for in-tree debugging of the D3D↔Metal
translation path, not for end-user diagnostics.

#### `clangd` configuration for proper language server support 

Since this project contains code runs on macOS/Windows(Wine)/both, `clangd` may not always be able to find the correct sysroot for e.g. libc++ include files. Add clangd argument `--query-driver=**/x86_64-w64-mingw32-**` may solve this problem. 

### Native Build

Build all components as Mach-O .dylib

```sh
meson setup -Dnative_llvm_path=</path/to/llvm> build-native --buildtype release
meson compile -C build-native
```

#### Side notes on building x86_64 target from arm64 device/environment

Apparently the simplist solution is to use a x86_64 shell, but you can also set following environment variables

```sh
export CFLAGS='-arch x86_64'
export CXXFLAGS='-arch x86_64'
# then perform `meson setup ...`
```


# Debugging
The following environment variables can be used for **debugging** purposes.
- `MTL_SHADER_VALIDATION=1` Enable Metal shader validation layer
- `MTL_DEBUG_LAYER=1` Enable Metal API validation layer
- `MTL_CAPTURE_ENABLED=1` Enable Metal frame capture
- `DXMT_CAPTURE_EXECUTABLE="the executable name without extension"` Must be set to enable Metal frame capture. Press F10 to generate a capture. The captured result will be stored in the same directory as the executable.
- `DXMT_CAPTURE_FRAME=n` Automatically capture n-th frame. Useful for debugging a replay.
- `DXMT_LOG_LEVEL=none|error|warn|info|debug` Controls message logging.
- `DXMT_LOG_PATH=/some/directory` Changes path where log files are stored. Set to `none` to disable log file creation entirely, without disabling logging.
- `DXMT_SHADER_CACHE=0`: Disables DXMT-managed shader cache files. The Metal framework PSO cache is still controlled by Metal itself.
- `DXMT_SHADER_CACHE_PATH=/some/absolute/darwin/directory`: Path to DXMT-managed shader cache files and the per-executable Metal framework cache directory. Defaults to `$(getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR)/dxmt/<executable name with extension>_<executable path hash>`.
- `DXMT_USE_DEFAULT_METAL_CACHE=1`: Leaves Metal's framework cache path at the system default instead of placing it under `DXMT_SHADER_CACHE_PATH`.
- `DXMT_DUMP_PATH=/some/directory`: Changes path where shader and pipeline dump files are stored. Falls back to `DXMT_LOG_PATH` when unset.
- `DXMT_DUMP_PIPELINES=0|problem|all`: Controls pipeline dumping. `problem` dumps known problematic pipelines, currently including mesh pipelines with rasterization enabled and no pixel shader; `all` dumps every graphics pipeline.
- `DXMT_DUMP_PIPELINE_KEY=hex-key|field=value[ field=value...][,field=value...]`: Restricts pipeline dumping to one logged pipeline key or to fields from the dumped pipeline manifest. Plain hex keys match the current process key. Field filters match stable manifest tokens such as `VS.bytes=5200 PS.bytes=5328 inputs=5 rtv0=87`; comma-separated groups are ORed and tokens inside a group are ANDed.
- `DXMT_DUMP_PIPELINE_VS|HS|DS|GS|PS=sha1|null`: Restricts pipeline dumping by stable shader SHA1 for the selected stage. Multiple stage filters are combined, which is useful when a pipeline key changes between process launches.
- `DXMT_DUMP_COMPUTE_SHADERS=sha1-or-prefix[,sha1-or-prefix...]|all`: Dumps compute shader bytecode when a matching compute pipeline is requested. Prefix matching is supported so shader function names such as `cs_a4e4c668_...` can be used directly as filters.


### Logs
When used with Wine, DXMT will print log messages to `stderr`. Additionally, standalone log files can optionally be generated by setting the `DXMT_LOG_PATH` variable, where log files in the given directory will be called `app_d3d11.log`, `app_dxgi.log` etc., where `app` is the name of the game executable.
